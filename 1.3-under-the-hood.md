### Under the hood
When we work in the admin dashboard or calling methods, we are really just doing database commands via a more user friendly interface. Behind the scene Wordpress writes and reads from a set of MySQL-tables created during install.

The Wordpress software runs on the web server and is written in PHP. When we are self-hosting Wordpress we need the following components in place:

 - Web server (commonly used are Ngninx or Apache)
 - PHP (currently version 7.0 or later)
 - MySQL Database
 - HTTPS-support (a security requirement introduced 2017)
