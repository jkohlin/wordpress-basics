## Translations

When building themes we are adding labels, descriptions and namings to admin dashbord and to our templates. Hard.coding these in one specific language is bad practice if our theme is not for personal use only. 

As theme developers we need to prepare our themes for use in any language. This does not mean we have to do any translation, just to make our themes **possible** to be translated into any language.

### Translation files
Wordpress handles translations with something called translation files. These are textfiles with key/value pairs of strings. The value-field holds the string which can be translated, and the key field is what we use in theme to output the translated string.

In the Wordpress' root we will find a folder called languages, with lagunage files for Wordpress' admin dashboard. The same principle applies to a theme, where we can have translation files in the folder `themes/theme-name/languages`. Each language is represented by three files:

`{language}.po`, `{language}.pot`, `{language}.mo`

These are just different versions of the same content, and will load when that specific language is defined in the current Wordpress configuration.

Example from swedish.po:

    #sidebar.php:8
      msgid "About the author"
      msgstr "Om f√∂rfattaren"


Then in sidebar.php, we can output the current translation with:
	
	<?php _e('About the author', 'my_theme_name_domain'); ?>

The second argument is a string, which defines the context of the translation. In a theme we can define this context and the folder to use, in the very top of the file `functions.php`:

	<?php load_theme_textdomain('my_theme_name_domain', get_template_directory() . '/languages'); ?>
