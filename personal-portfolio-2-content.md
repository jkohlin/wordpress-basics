##  Assignment 2 - Content
Content is still king and should control the presentation of both the backend and frontend views. A Wordpress theme can adapt both frontend templates and admin dashboard. Below is the content plan, where you can find which post types and taxonomies we need to prepare for and what content to create. You can add other content later, but stick to the plan for now.
