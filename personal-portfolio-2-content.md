##  Assignment 2 - Content
Via the theme we can adapt both frontend templates and admin dashboard, to fit the content. Below is the content plan, where you can find which post types and taxonomies we need to prepare for and what content to create. You can add other content later, but stick to the plan for now.

#### Tasks
1. Register all required post types and taxonomies from the content plan.
