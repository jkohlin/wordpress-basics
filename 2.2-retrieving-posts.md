## Retrieveing posts
When we develop themes, much of the work is about retrieving a specific post and output its data. Wordpress has a simple content API with methods to retrieve one or many posts. These methods will eventually trigger SQL-code and return the found post or posts as an object array in PHP. We can use this in our templates to output the post data.

### The Query
Wordpress has a class called **WP_Query** with methods to retrieve posts from the database. Its instance will always be present in our Wordpress template code and we don't have to create it. By default the query retrieves the post which the call was made from. This will be returned as an array containing only that single post object.

In cases where we want to retrieve content from other posts we can manually intantiate the **WP_query** class, and pass in parameters to pinpoint only the exact post or post**s** we want to retrieve.

### The Loop
Iterating through the array of post objects is commonly refered to as *The Loop*. Methods from the WP_Query object helps doing this with minimal efforts. The two main methods used for creating the post loop are:

**have_posts()** 
Will return *true* as long as the current query object has posts in it. 

**the_post()** 
Used inside the loop to set up the current post object. This exposes methods we can use to directly access the data fields of that post. **It also tells the  the loop to iterate one step forward.**

Here is a simple implementation of The Loop which we can use in templates to get the current post object:
```
<?php 
// The Loop
if(have_posts()):

    while ( have_posts():
        the_post();
        //Do something with the post data
    endwhile;
    
endif;

?>
```

Another example using a custom query instead of the default one:

```
<?php 


// The Query
$the_query = new WP_Query( array( 'category_name' => 'cats' ) );

// The Loop
if($the_query->have_posts()):
    $the_query->the_post();
    while ( $the_query->have_posts()
        //Do something with each post object
    endwhile;
    
endif;

?>
```
### Inside the Loop
When calling `the_post()` inside our loop we are setting up the current post in the loop, and exposing a set of global variables and methods we can use to output post data. Using these variables and methods will be covered more in the Templates section of this course.
