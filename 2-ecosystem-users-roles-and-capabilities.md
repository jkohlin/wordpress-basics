# Users, roles and capabilities

To manage content and settings in Wordpress you need to be a registered user on that specific Wordpress installation. Having a user account in Wordpress is much like a user account on any social platform, like Facebook or Twitter. You will get a username and enter some basic information about yourself. You will also get a user rank, which controls what information you are allowed to see and edit in admin dashboard. This rank is in Wordpress called **role**.

The different roles in Wordpress:

- Super Admin
- Administrator
- Editor
- Author
- Contributor
- Subscriber

Each of the default roles have different **capabilites** applied to them which are what Wordpress use to determine what a user is allowed to se and edit. There are hundreds of pre-defined capabilities which are nothing but text strings with names describing the capability.

Some examples:

- edit_pages
- edit_posts
- edit_private_pages
- edit_private_posts
- edit_published_pages
- edit_published_posts
- edit_theme_options
- export
- import
- list_users
- manage_categories
- manage_links
- manage_options
