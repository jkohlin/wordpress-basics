# Users, roles and capabilities

To manage content and settings in Wordpress you need to be a registered user on that specific Wordpress installation. Having a user account in Wordpress is much like a user account on any social platform, like Facebook or Twitter. You will get a username and enter some basic information about yourself. You will also get a user rank, which controls what information you are allowed to see and edit in admin dashboard. This rank is in Wordpress called **role**.

The different roles in Wordpress are
- Super Admin – somebody with access to the site network administration features and all other features.
- Administrator (slug: 'administrator') – somebody who has access to all the administration features within a single site.
- Editor (slug: 'editor') – somebody who can publish and manage posts including the posts of other users.
- Author (slug: 'author') – somebody who can publish and manage their own posts.
- Contributor (slug: 'contributor') – somebody who can write and manage their own posts but cannot publish them.
- Subscriber (slug: 'subscriber') – somebody who can only manage their profile.
