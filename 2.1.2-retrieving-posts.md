## Retrieveing posts
When we develop themes, much of the work is about retrieving a specific post and output its data. Wordpress has a simple content API with methods to retrive one or many posts. These methods will eventually trigger SQL-code and return the found post or posts as an object array in PHP. With this array of post objects we can iterate through each post and access thedata fields. 

### The Loop and Query
The Wordpress Loop refers to a set of Wordpress methods which will let us iterate trough an array of post objects. This aray of post objects comes from something called **Wordpress query**. By default we don't have to pass any query to The loop, as the default query will be be the current post or page the call was made from.

In cases where we want to retrieve content from other posts we can use Wordpress **WP_query** class, with methods where we can pass in parameters to pinpoint only the exact post or post**s** we would want.

Some of the methods from the **WP_query** class we can use in our templates to retrieve posts:

**have_posts()** 
Will return a boolean telling if the current query has any posts. Are used outside The Loop and in the loops definition:

```
<?php 
// The Loop
if(have_posts()):

    while ( have_posts()
        //Do something with each post object
    endwhile;
    
endif;

?>
```

Another example using a custom query instead of the default:

```
<?php 


// The Query
$the_query = new WP_Query( array( 'category_name' => 'cats' ) );

// The Loop
if($the_query->have_posts()):

    while ( $the_query->have_posts()
        //Do something with each post object
    endwhile;
    
endif;

?>
```
