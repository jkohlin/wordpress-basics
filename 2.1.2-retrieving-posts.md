## Retrieveing posts
When we develop themes, much of the work is about retrieving a specific post and output its data. Wordpress has a simple content API with methods to retrieve one or many posts. These methods will eventually trigger SQL-code and return the found post or posts as an object array in PHP. With this array of post objects we can iterate through each post and access their data fields.

### The Query
Wordpress has a class called **WP_Query** with methods to retrieve posts from the database. Its instance will always be present in our Wordpress template code and we don't have to create it. By default the query retrieves the post which the call was made from. This will be returned as an array containing only that single post object.

In cases where we want to retrieve content from other posts we can manually intantiate the **WP_query** class, and pass in parameters to pinpoint only the exact post or post**s** we want to retrieve.

### The Loop
Iterating through the array of post objects is commonly refered to as The Loop. Methods from the query object helps doing this with minimal efforts. The two main methods used for creating the post loop are:

**have_posts()** 
Will return a boolean telling if the current query has any posts. Are used outside The Loop and also in the loop's definition.

**the_post()** 
Used inside The Loop to set up the current post in the array. This exposes methods we can use to directly access the data fields of that post. **It also tells the while-loop to iterate one step forward.**

```
<?php 
// The Loop
if(have_posts()):

    while ( have_posts():
        the_post();
        //Do something with each post object
    endwhile;
    
endif;

?>
```

Another example using a custom query instead of the default one:

```
<?php 


// The Query
$the_query = new WP_Query( array( 'category_name' => 'cats' ) );

// The Loop
if($the_query->have_posts()):
    $the_query->the_post();
    while ( $the_query->have_posts()
        //Do something with each post object
    endwhile;
    
endif;

?>
```
### Inside the Loop
After calling `the_post()` we can use other Wordpress methods to output or handle the post's data. These will be covered more in the Templates section of this course.

Wrapping it up, here is an example of how we can create a simple Loop to output the current post's content and title:

```
<?php 
// The Loop
if(have_posts()):

    while ( have_posts():
        the_post();
        
        the_title();
        the_content();
        
    endwhile;
    
endif;

?>
```
