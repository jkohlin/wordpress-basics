## Assignment 2 - Personal portfolio

We are going to build a portfolio theme for a personal presentation along with any kind of creative content. The theme will be built as a standalone Wordpress theme, meaning we will not extend or adjust an already built theme, instead we will build it from scratch.

Note: After the assignment you will have a simple yet fully working Wordpress theme ready to be used on a live website. For further development and maintenance we recommended that you optimize both the theme and development workflow.

### Prerequisites
Before anything else you will need the following:

* A working local wordpress installation
* Git installed locally
* A Github account

### 1 - Theme setup

1. Generate your personal theme repository:

2. Clone the Github repository into your local themes folder (make sure to pick the SSH clone URL).
3. Change the theme's name to anything you want, and perform a `git push` to the Github repository.
4. Activate your new theme from Wordpress admin.


### 2 - Page structure
The content is the core of a website and should be the first thing to plan. A this assignment is about building a Wordpress theme only, we will assume the content plan already has been laid out for us. The content will consist of a person bio and the work. The following pages should be created via Wordpress admin:

   - Home
   - About
   - Contact

For now, add some example content on each page. A good practice is to describe the purpose of the page. We will come back and change the content later.

### 3 - Style plan
You will be presented
