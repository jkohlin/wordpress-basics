## Assignment 2 - Personal portfolio

We are going to build a portfolio theme for a personal presentation along with any kind of creative content. The theme will be built as a standalone Wordpress theme, meaning we will not extend or adjust another already built theme, but rather built it from scratch.

Note: After the assignment you will have a simple yet fully working Wordpress theme ready to be used on a live server. For further development and maintenance we recommended that you optimize both theme and workflow, which we will covered briefly in the final words.

For this course you will be provided with a personal Github repository, prepared with all the files and folders needed to activate and start coding your theme.

### Prerequisites
Before anything else you will need the following:

* A working local wordpress installation
* Git installed locally
* A Github account

### 1 - Theme setup

1. Generate your personal theme repository:

2. Clone the Github repository into your local themes folder (make sure to pick the SSH clone URL).
3. Change the theme's name to anything you want, and perform a `git push` to the Github repository.
4. Activate your new theme from Wordpress admin.

### 2 - Page layout
Now when your theme is active it's time to lay out the site's structure. In Wordpress admin, create the following page structure:

   - Home
      - About me
      - Projects
      - Contact

Make sure to add something in each of the pages's content field. A couple of lines describing the page's purpose is recommended.
