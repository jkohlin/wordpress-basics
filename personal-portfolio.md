## Assignment 2 - Personal portfolio

We are going to build a portfolio theme for a personal presentation along with any kind of creative content. The theme will be built as a standalone Wordpress theme, meaning we will not extend or adjust an already built theme, instead we will build it from scratch.

**Note: After the assignment you will have a simple yet fully working Wordpress theme ready to be used on a live website. For further development and maintenance we recommended that you optimize both the theme and development workflow.**

### Prerequisites
Before anything else you will need the following:

* A working local wordpress installation
* Git installed locally
* A Github account

### 1 - Theme setup

1. Generate your personal theme repository:

3. Change the theme's name to anything you want, and perform a `git push` to the Github repository.
4. Activate your new theme from Wordpress admin.
