## Assignment 2 - Personal portfolio

We are going to build a portfolio theme for a personal presentation along with any kind of creative content. The theme will be built as a standalone Wordpress theme, meaning we will not extend or adjust another already built theme.

Note: After the assignment you will have a simple but fully working Wordpress theme ready to be used on a live server. For further development and maintenance you should optimize both theme and workflow, which we will cover briefly in the final words.

You will be provided with a personal Github repository, prepared with all the files and folders needed to activate your theme.

### Prerequisites
Before anything you will need the following:

* A working local wordpress installation
* Git installed locally
* A Github account

### 1 - Theme setup

1. Generate your personal theme repository:

2. Clone the Github repository into your local themes folder (make sure to pick the SSH clone URL).
3. Change the theme's name to anything you want, and perform a git push to the Github repository.
3. Activate your new theme from Wordpress admin dashboard. 



### 2 - Page setup
Now when your theme is active it's time to lay out the website's structure. In Wordpress admin, create the following page structure:

   - Home
      - About me
      - Projects
      - Contact
