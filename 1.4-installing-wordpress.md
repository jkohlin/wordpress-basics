## Installing Wordpress

When we have all server requirements in place, we need to download the Wordpress software from [Download Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/download/). From there we can choose Wordpress in our own language, or chose the default (english) and download our language-files later.

When downloading Wordpress this way, a zip-file is what we get. Inside is a complete Wordpress installation with a couple of example themes to try everything out. After extraction we can move everything to our web server's document root, and begin the installation process via a web browser.

If the web server is configured correctly, we are greeted with a welcome screen with the option to start the installation process. That is a step-by-step guide with form fields to enter basic information like database details, site URL and name of the site. The last step is about creating the first Wordpress User, which will have full capabilities in the admin dashboard.

## wp_config.php
While the installation guide runs and we enter data, Wordpress will write those details into a file called wp_config.php. In that file we store site wide settings and security information used by Wordpress software. Everything in this file can be edited manually later at any point, the guide only help us to set up the basics.

## Database tables
Wordpress will also begin to populate our before empty database, creating tables with a shared prefix. One table which will hole most of the setup data is *wp_options*. Also *wp_users* will get its first user, who will become the Super Admin.
