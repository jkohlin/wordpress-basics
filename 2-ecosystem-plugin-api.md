## Plugin API

Wordpress has a Plugin API which is built around *hooks*. We can use hooks to control and extend Wordpress default behavior, from our theme or from encapsulated modules (Wordpress plugins).

### Wordpress hooks
A hook comes in two versions: *action hooks* and *filter hooks*. They both enables us to inject or alter functionality and content.
