# Assignment 2 - Personal portfolio

We are going to build a portfolio theme for a personal presentation along with any kind of creative content. The theme will be built as a standalone Wordpress theme, 

> Note: After the assignment you will have a simple yet fully working Wordpress theme ready to be used on a live website. For further development and maintenance we recommended that you optimize both theme and development workflow.

### Prerequisites
Before anything else you will need the following:

* A working local wordpress installation
* Git installed locally
* A Github account

## 1 - Project setup
Your theme will be version controlled with Git, and have a personal remote repository on Github. First step is to clone the already existing reposity into the theme-folder of your local Wordpress installation.

#### Tasks
1. Generate your personal theme repository via Github Classroom:
https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/ba4e0df3e4a0ef72dbd393bc72ef3b36 
2. Clone the Github repository into your local themes folder (make sure you pick the SSH clone URL).

## 2 - Theme setup
In the folder you just cloned we now need to add the very basic files required by Wordpress to treat the files as a theme. The files are empty, and it's now up to you to fill them out with the required code.

#### Tasks
1. Create the following files:
	- your-theme-folder
    	- style.css
        - functions.php
        - index.php
        
2. Add the following information to style.css and replace the content with your personal information.
```
	/*
	Theme Name: My Theme Name
	Theme URI: http://farkost.se
	Author: Johan Kohlin
	*/
```

3. Save your `style.css` file and activate your new theme via Wordpress Dashboard (Appearence->Theme).

4. Commit and push your new theme back to Github.

## 3 - Content plan
Below are the wireframes describing all required templates and their layout. Create them by using Wordpress templates and template parts, and try not to repeat yourself when building them.
