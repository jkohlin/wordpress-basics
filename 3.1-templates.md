## Templates

A template is like a blueprint describing how to present a Wordpress post on the frontend. From a template file, we have access to Wordpress methods used for reading the post content and render as HTML.

### Template body
The end mission of a template file is to render a complete HTML-page. This includes common tags like <html>, <head> and <body>. Having more than one template file in a theme would then mean a lot of duplicate code, which we do not want. So for these common parts we would create separate files and include them with PHP in all our template files.

### Header
The html start tags and other common top-of-the-page-code we want to start all templates with, will then be stored inside a file called `header.php` located in the theme root. We include this into a template by calling `get_header()`. This file will also have an important method call `wp_head()` which will expose all Wordpress methods for us. If we don't create a `header.php` in our theme, Wordpress will include a default header.php from outside the theme.

### Footer
The html end tags and things like scripts and other common bottom-of-the-page-code will be stored in `footer.php`, which will be included by calling `get_footer()` from our template. 

Everything else inbetween these two is where we output the content of the current post.

```
<?php

    get_header(); //Calls in 
        
        //Code to render post content
        
    get_footer();

?>
```

We can specify exactly which template to use for a specific post, or let Wordpress pick the template at runtime. A set of naming rules will then look for files in our theme folder and find which template to use. If none is specified, and no matching filename found, Wordpress will select the required file **index.php** to render the post.

> Note: All templates must be PHP-files and located in the theme's root folder to be recognized by Wordpress. 

**The template hierarchy for hierarchial post (ie. pages):**
1. Template name – The page template manually assigned to the page.
2. page-{slug}.php – If the page slug is recent-news, WordPress will look to use page-recent-news.php.
3. page-{id}.php – If the page ID is 6, WordPress will look to use page-6.php.
4. page.php
5. singular.php
6. index.php

**The template hierarchy for non-hierarchial post (ie. posts):**
1. single-{post-type}-{slug}.php – (Since 4.4) First, WordPress looks for a template for the specific post. For example, if post type is product and the post slug is dmc-12, WordPress would look for single-product-dmc-12.php.
2. single-{post-type}.php – If the post type is product, WordPress would look for single-product.php.
3. single.php – WordPress then falls back to single.php.
4. singular.php – Then it falls back to singular.php.
5. index.php – Finally, as mentioned above, WordPress ultimately falls back to index.php.

> Creating new templates shall be done with care. One same template can present content i various ways with the help of PHP logic. Only create new templates when the content variations are severe.
