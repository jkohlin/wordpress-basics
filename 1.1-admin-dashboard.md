## Admin Dashboard

The admin dashboard is the private area where registered users manage the site's content. A login with username and password is required to access the dashboard, and each registered user will have different level of access and capabilities.

A main navigation is used to navigate between different sections, all with different content to manage. These are the default sections:

**Posts** Browse, Create, Delete and Edit posts.
**Pages** Browse, Create, Delete and Edit pages.
**Media** Browse, Upload, Delete and Edit media files.
**Comments** Manage comments added to posts.
**Appearence** Manage themes and widgets.
**Plugins** Browse and manage installed Wordpress plugins.
**Users** Browse and manage User and current user's profile settings.
**Settings** Manage site wide settings.

Which of these sections a user have, depends on that user's roles and capabilities.
