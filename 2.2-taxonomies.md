#Taxonomies

Having lots of content requires solutions for our users to find relevant information. Taxonomies are used to categorize and group related content with a shared vocabulary.

Let's say we were to sell cars, and had a lot of cars to choose from. For a user to find the right car we'd need to group and categorize them by feature. For the sake of simplicity, we will categorize them by two features; color and brand. We'll need two taxonomies in this case, *color* and *brand*. 

Each of these two taxonomies will have values, and starting with color the values will be something like *yellow*, *red*, *green*. These values are called **terms** and are in a way children of the taxonomy **color**.

With our content mapped into taxonomy terms, Wordpress will create taxonomy-based archives accessible via URLs. Eg. We could get a list of all our green cars by visiting *www.wesellcars.com/cars/colors/green/*.

When a new car post is being created or edited via admin dashboard, we would want the editor to apply the relevant terms into some kind of input field. 

We need to tell Wordpress about our taxonomy.

## Defining new taxonomies
As a developer we cannot assume or limit which these term values will be. It must be up to the  editor to add these when creating and managing his content. We will however need to describe the taxonomy and it's behaviors.

While taxonomy's terms are stored in the database, the taxonomies are not. Instead a taxonomy is added in runtime and needs to be defined with PHP, presumably in the theme's file `functions.php`. This is how we would create the taxonomy *color* in Wordpress:

	register_taxonomy( 'color', 'cars', $args );

This built in method `register_taxonomy` takes three arguments, the first being the name of the taxonomy. As a second parameter we need to tell Wordpress which post type the taxonomy applies to. The third parameter is an object array containing more options about the taxonomy's behavior.

### Taxonomy arguments
| argument  |  purpose | possible values
|---|---|
| hierarchial  |  If the taxonomy terms can be structured with parents and children or not | true/false
| label  | The display name in admin dashboard | string |
| rewrite  | The naming of the URL parameter in archives  | string or boolean |

*Apart from these arguments there are more specific arguments for display labeling.*
