## Taxonomies

Having lots of content makes it harder for our self and our audience to find relevant information. We can use something called *taxonomies* to categorize and group related content with a shared vocabulary.

A taxonomy is a *category dimension* with a name and rules for the actual categories. If our website is about selling cars, we might have a lot of car posts in our system. We would then need some way of categorizing and group them. An obvious dimension is the brand and maybe another for the color. For this we would then need two taxonomies: *brand* and *color*.

Each of these two taxonomies will have actutal *category values*. For the *color* taxonomy the values would be something like *yellow*, *red*, *green*. These values are called **terms** and can be seen as the children of the taxonomy. The terms of a taxonomy are connected to a specific post, and is managed just like the post's content. 

As developers we cannot assume which the exact terms will be used. Our job is only to describe the taxonomies, which post type they should apply to and their rules and behavior.

With Wordpress comes two default taxonomies: *category* and *tag*. They are applied only to the *post* post type and cannot be used for pages. The two taxonomies differ much like the post types *post* and *page*. One is hieraechial (category), meaning its terms can be ordered in a tree-like structure with parents and children. The other taxonomy is non-hierarchial (tag) and therefor has all its terms in the same level.

## Admin usage
To manage the terms for a specific post, all we have to do is browsing to the post in the Wordpress Dashboard and write in any term in the meta boxes for the taxonomy in question.

## Frontend usage
With our content mapped into colors, Wordpress creates taxonomy-based archives accessible via URLs. Eg. We could get a list of all our green cars by visiting *www.cars.com/cars/colors/green/*.

## Developer usage
While a taxonomy's terms are stored in the database together with the post, the taxonomy is defined at runtime meaning it needs to be defined with PHP, presumably in the file `functions.php`. This is how we would create the taxonomy *color* in Wordpress:

	register_taxonomy( 'color', 'cars', $args );

This built in method `register_taxonomy` takes three arguments, the first being the name of the taxonomy. As a second parameter we need to tell Wordpress which post type the taxonomy applies to. The third parameter is an object array containing more options about the taxonomy's behavior.

### Taxonomy arguments
| argument  |  purpose | possible values
|---|---|---|
| hierarchial  |  If the taxonomy terms can be structured with parents and children or not | true/false
| label  | The display name in admin dashboard | string |
| rewrite  | The naming of the URL parameter in archives  | string or boolean |

*Apart from these arguments there are more specific arguments for display labeling.*
