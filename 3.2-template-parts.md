## Template parts
Just like with the template's header and footer, there will be scenarious where also template code are using common code. By wrapping this common code into separate files, we can reduce the amount of code and simplify maintenance.

These files will be called *template parts* and becomes the building blocks of our templates. When included the template parts will get access to everything as of they were directly coed into that template.

Template part files can be located anywhere in our theme, but best practice is to keep them inside their own folder.

`get_template_part( 'my-name-part' ); //Would locate my-template-part.php`

The argument passedis the filename ofthe template part, without the extension. Wordpress will look for the file in the theme's root directory, but if we had all our template parts in another folder we would have to include that path in the argument.

`<?php get_template_part('partialss/my-name-part'); ?>`

### Template part variants
We sometimes have the need for more than one variant of a template parts. We can then create a duplicate of a teplate part file and append the filename with a descriptive key. This key is passed as a second argument in the method:

`get_template_part( 'my-name-part', 'v2' ); //Would locate my-template-part-v2.php`
