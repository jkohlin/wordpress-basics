## Post Meta

Post meta is extended data fields for posts, but stored in a separate database table *wp_post_meta*. The rows in this table are key/value pairs with a reference to a specific post ID in wp_posts table. This enables us to extend the default content fields of a post. In the admin dashboard, these key/value pairs are refered to as custom fields.

### Adding custom fields
1. In admin Dashboard, browse to the post you want to edit. 
2. Activate the panel for custom fields in the Dashboard's Panel Settings.
3. Add as many custom field pairs you need and save/publish the post.

*Attn. Make sure the post type of the current post supports custom fields.*

### Meta boxes
Sometimes we want more content aware input fields than simple key/value strings. We can do this by creating Wordpress *Meta Boxes*, which enables a developer to create the input form, and how to save the entered data.

A more common aproach of creating Meta Boxes is by using a plugin. They often comes with a Dashboard section where any user can create and define advanced input fields. The most popular plugin as of writing is called *Advanced Custom Fields*.
