## The Wordpress Post
The wordpress post is a data model which is used to hold content. As default they are used for almost any content used in Wordpress, but with variations of the content model. These variations of the model are called *post types*.

Two similar post types are 'post' and 'page'. They both are available after Wordpress install and don't have to be registered by a developer. 

### Post
Not to be confused with the **Wordpress Post**, the *post* **post type** is just one of many types. If you are running a blog or blog or a website with any editorial content, each article, blog entry or similar would be written as a post. This post type is non-hierarchial meaning they cannot be ordered in a tree-like structure with parents and children, instead all posts live at the same level. Posts are often ordered by their publish date.

### Page
The *page* **post type** is in contrast to *post* hierarchal and can thereby be ordered in a tree-like structure, which make this post type perfect for building pages and sub-pages in a regular website. Pages are often ordered manually instead of their publish date.
