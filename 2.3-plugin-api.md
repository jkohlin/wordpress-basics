## Plugin API

Wordpress comes with a Plugin API which makes it easy for developers to extend Wordpress default behavior. Central in this API is something called *hooks*. Developers can use them to *hook* their own code into existing code, without touching the original version. The Wordpress hook comes in two versions: *action hook* and *filter hook*. They work much like events which we can listen for and do something with when triggered.

### Action hooks
To make use of an already defined action hook we need to create an *action*, and tell that action which hook we are waiting for, and what to do when it's triggered. We can also define new action hooks which let other developers hook into our code.

**Defining an action hook (event):**
	
    do_action( ‘my_custom_hook’ );

**Adding an action (listener):**

	add_action('my_custom_hook', 'my_cool_function');
    
    static function my_cool_function()  {
      //Do something cool on the server side.
    }

### Filter hooks
Filter hooks are similar but will also expose data for us to alter in some way, thereof called filters.
They are often defined where data is being outputed, giving us a chance to control exatcly how the data will be outputed.

**Defining a filter hook (event):**

	$this_author = the_author_meta( 'display_name' ) //The_author_meta(), är det en inbyggd wp-funktion? I vilken kontext körs den? 'display_name' är en av flera saker den kan returnera? 
	echo apply_filters('author_name', $this_author); //The filter hook beeing echoed out. || apply_filters = definiera en filter-hook? || author_name är det ett valfritt ord för en filter hook? Varför skriva ut den när vi definierar den? Det är mycket jag inte förstår här.
    
**Adding an filter (listener):**

    add_filter( 'author_name', 'reverse_author_name' );
    
    function reverse_author_name($author_name) {
      return strrev($author_name); //Return the filtered content
    }
    
 ### Encapsulating functionality
 
We can use a theme's `function.php` to define and listen for hooks. Another option, which let's us extend both the current theme and Wordpress core is to create a plugin.

Plugins runs parallell to the theme and can be managed easily by a user from the admin dashboard. We can publish a plugin to make it available to the community.

A plugin can do anything, but we should strive for creating plugins with a clear mission. While our theme lives inside `wp-content/themes` plugins live in `wp-content/plugin`.

## Defining a plugin

All we really need is a PHP-file with a plugin header. This header describe the plugin and tell something about the author and licence. But the only required header information is the plugin's name.

    <?php
    /*
    Plugin Name: Reverse author plugin
    */

When placed in the plugin folder, a plugin called *"Reverse authro plugin"* will show up in admin dashboard where a user can turn it on and off.

Now, in same plugin file, we can use the filter hook we made earlier to reverse the author's name on the website.

	<?php
	/*
	Plugin Name: Reverse author plugin
	*/

	add_filter( 'author_name', 'change_site_main_link' );
    
    function reverse_author_name($author_name) {
      return strrev($author_name); //Return the filtered content
    }
    
And our plugin is created! We can do much more, and should probably wrap the code inside a class. But we don't have to.
