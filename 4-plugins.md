### Wordpress Plugins
We can use a theme's `function.php` to extend Wordpress behavior with hooks without touching the original code. Our own theme methods can be prepared with new hooks to make our theme easy to extend. To extend the current theme from the outside we can use Wordpress Plugins. Plugins runs parallell to the theme and can be managed from the admin dashboard.

We can create our own plugins, or download and install other developers' published plugins. 

## Installing a plugin

1. From the Dashboard we can navigate to Plugins->Add new
2. From here we can search and install any plugin, or upload a previously downloaded plugin.
3. Activate the new plugin.

> When we manually download plugins their file(s) should be placed in the folder `wp-content/plugins` to become visible in the plugin list.

> Wordpress plugins can be browsed from http://wordpress.org/plugins
