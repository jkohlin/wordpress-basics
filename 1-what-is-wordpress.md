## What is Wordpress?

Wordpress is a Content Management System (CMS) which is used for *creating, managing and serving content*. 

The software is written in PHP and contains operations for writing, reading and rendering of data. Central in this is the Wordpress Dashboard, a graphical user interface from where these operations can be made without any programming skills. To manage settings and content authentication is required, which is done via the User API.

### Who owns Wordpress?
The brand and trademark is owned by the Wordpress Foundation, a charitable organisation founded by the author of the code base. The code base it self is open source and maintained by the community, refering to anyone involved with writing code, designing or taking part in the development. 

Anyone can get the source code for Wordpress and start making improvements or create a completely new product. The core developer team will review all pull requests and implement them if the community approves. This way Wordpress is kept relevant and in sync with the ever changing web. 

### Updates
It's important to keep Worpdress installations up to date, which can be done easily from the admin dashboard. New releases with security fixes and improvements becomes available many times a year. All the old version's weakness and bugs are then out in the for anyone to use against you. So try keep up with the releases.

### Hosted vs. Self hosted
The aproach of setting up Wordpress on your own server, is in Wordpress terms refered to as 'self-hosted Wordpress'. It's this variant we are refering to in this course.

Another variant is to use Wordpress.com, a service where Wordpress is already installed and kept updated by a professional team. All you need to do is sign up and you're good to go. You will get a personal URL to your website which makes this solution a quick and easy way to start blogging or running a simple website. The drawbacks of this variant are the limited capabilities of the admin dashboard and theme.

### History and future
Back in 2001 a guy named Michael Valdrighi created and released a simple weblog tool called b2/Cafelog. It used a new concept of dynamically generating pages from a database, which made it a powerful tool for blogging. After its release Michael suddenly dissapeared and development stalled. Two years later, a developer named Matt Mullenweg took the open sourced sourcecode to b2/Cafelog, and made some changes and improvements to it. Wordpress was born and quickly gained popularity.

Today, 14 years later, Wordpress is often considered the standard tool for managing website content. However it has been hugely criticied for beeing easy to hack, and is not longer considered to be the most lightweight and user friendly alternative.

New content managers tend to go towards more lightweight and simple ecosystem without the rendering part. Wordpress has already started to introduce a REST API to serve it's content with JSON instead of HTML.
