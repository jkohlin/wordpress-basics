## What is Wordpress?

Wordpress is the open source blogging platform which became the leading content management system (CMS) for websites. It never dropped itâ€™s blogging capabilities, but from around version 3.0 it came to handle content far beyond just blog posts.

First of all, Wordpress is a tool for *creating content*. As a website owner or editor you will get access to an area hidden from everyone else - the admin dashboard. This is where you write and edit your content. The simple and user friendly interface is what made and still makes Wordpress so popular. From the admin dashboard you have full control over the website, not only it's editorial content.

### Open source
So, who owns Wordpress? There is actually no company behind it, and with that no commercial interests. Instead Wordpress is owned and maintained by 'the community', refering to anyone involved with writing code or reporting issues and ideas. 

Anyone can retrieve the source code for Wordpress and start making improvements. The core developer team will then review your code and might just accept the contribution you made. With hundreds of developers working together, Wordpress is kept relevant and in sync with the ever changing web. 

Every month the Wordpress team will push out new releases, which is important to know when using Wordpress. Your job as a the owner or maintainer of a Wordpress website is to keep up with all updates, and make sure your Wordpress installation using the latest release all the time.

### How it works
What you see when using Wordpress is really just at GUI for the database, with user friendly fields and buttons to enter data. A MySQL database for storing your content.

When using Wordpress for public websites, Wordpress will handle your HTTP requests, fetching the data and with that data render templates, which are returned as HTML-files to the visitors as a response.

The Wordpress ecosystem is built with PHP which is a server language, meaning you'll need a web server to run Wordpress. Wrapping it up, here is what Wordpress requires to run:

 - Web server (commonly used are Ngninx or Apache)
 - PHP (currently version 7.0 or later)
 - MySQL Database
 - HTTPS-support (a security requirement introduced 2017)

### Hosted vs. Self hosted
The aproach of running Wordpress on your own, by using your own web server or on a hosting provider, is in Wordpress terms refered to as 'self-hosted Wordpress'. What that really means is that you are in total control of the Wordpress software and will have to set up everything yourself. There are hosting providers which offers so called 1-click installs of Wordpress, but in the end of the day it's up to you as the website owner everything work.
