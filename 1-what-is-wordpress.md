## What is Wordpress?

Wordpress is the open source blogging platform which became the leading content management system for websites. It never dropped itâ€™s blogging capabilities, but from around version 3.0 it came to handle content far beyond just blog posts.

First of all, Wordpress is a tool for *creating content*. As a website owner or editor you will get access to an area hidden from everyone else - the admin dashboard. This is where you write and edit your content. The simple and user friendly interface is what made and still makes Wordpress so popular. From the admin dashboard you have full control over the website, not only it's editorial content.

### How it works
What you see when using Wordpress is really just at GUI for the database. Wordpress is using a MySQL database for storing your content.

When using Wordpress for public websites, Wordpress will handle your HTTP requests, fetching the data and with that data render templates, which are returned as HTML-files to the visitors as a response.

The Wordpress ecosystem is built with PHP which is a server language, which creates the demand for a web server to run Wordpress. The official requirements for hosting are as follows:

- PHP 7 or greater
- MySQL 5.6 or greater OR MariaDB 10.0 or greater
- The mod_rewrite Apache module
- HTTPS support
