## What is Wordpress?

Wordpress is a Content Management System (CMS) wich is used for *creating, managing and serving content*. The Wordpress software exposes a set of classes and methods used to read from and write to a underlying database. Wordpress also comes with a graphic admin area called Wordpress Dashboard. From this dashboard anyone can manage content and settings without any programming skills. To access any content management we need to authenticate via the built in User system.

### Who owns Wordpress?
The brand and trademark is owned by the Wordpress Foundation, a charitable organisation founded by the author of the code base. The code base it self is open source and maintained by the community, refering to anyone involved with writing code, designing or taking part in the development. 

Anyone can get the source code for Wordpress and start making improvements or create a completely new product. The core developer team will review all pull requests and implement them if the community approves. This way Wordpress is kept relevant and in sync with the ever changing web. 

### Updates
It's important to keep Worpdress installations up to date, which can be done easily from the admin dashboard. New releases with security fixes and improvements becomes available many times a year. All the old version's weakness and bugs are then out in the for anyone to use against you. So try keep up with the releases.

### Hosted vs. Self hosted
The aproach of running Wordpress on your own, by using your own web server or a hosting provider, is in Wordpress terms refered to as 'self-hosted Wordpress'. What that really means is that you are responsible for setting up everything yourself. There are hosting providers which offers easy installs of Wordpress, but in the end of the day it's up to you as the owner for everything to work.

Another aproach to this is using Wordpress.com, a service where Wordpress is already installed and kept updated by a professional team. All you need to do is sign up and you're good to go. You will get a personal URL to your website which makes this solution a quick and easy way to start blogging or running a simple website. The drawback of this solution is that you will have very limited capabilities of the admin dashboard. Therefor you will not be in total control of your website, just your content. This aproach is called 'Hosted Wordpress', and behind the website is a company called Automattic.

### History and future
Wordpress is the open source blogging platform which became the leading content management system (CMS) for websites. It never dropped its blogging capabilities, but from around version 3.0 it came to handle content far beyond just blog posts.

Back in 2001 a guy named Michael Valdrighi created and released a simple weblog tool called b2/Cafelog. It used a new concept of dynamically generating pages from a database, which made it a powerful tool for blogging. After its release Michael suddenly dissapeared and development stalled. Two years later, a developer named Matt Mullenweg took the open sourced sourcecode to b2/Cafelog, and made some changes and improvements to it. Wordpress was born and quickly gained popularity because of its user friendly interface and free of charge.

Today, 14 years later, Wordpress is often considered the standard tool for managing website content. However it has been hugely criticied for beeing unsafe and easy to hack, and is not longer considered to be the lightweight and user friendly alternative.

The CMS world is in the middle of a new shift, towards more lightweight and simple content management, mainly focused on managing content and deliver the data via an API insted of HTML. Beeing an extremely evolving software, Wordpress has already started to introduce a REST API to become the headless CMS.
