## What is Wordpress?

Wordpress is the open source blogging platform which became the leading content management system (CMS) for websites. It never dropped itâ€™s blogging capabilities, but from around version 3.0 it came to handle content far beyond just blog posts.

First of all, Wordpress is a tool for *creating content*. As a website owner or editor you will get access to an area hidden from everyone else - the admin dashboard. This is where you write and edit your content. The simple and user friendly interface is what made and still makes Wordpress so popular. From the admin dashboard you have full control over the website, not only it's editorial content.

Thanks to a built in account system called Users, many people can have access to the same admin dashboard and manage the content together.

### How it works
What you see when using Wordpress is really just at GUI for the database, with user friendly fields and buttons to enter data. A MySQL database for storing your content.

When using Wordpress for public websites, Wordpress will handle your HTTP requests, fetching the data and with that data render templates, which are returned as HTML-files to the visitors as a response.

The Wordpress ecosystem is built with PHP which is a server language, meaning you'll need a web server to run Wordpress. Wrapping it up, here is what Wordpress requires to run:

 - Web server (commonly used are Ngninx or Apache)
 - PHP (currently version 7.0 or later)
 - MySQL Database
 - HTTPS-support (a security requirement introduced 2017)
