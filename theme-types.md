## Theme types

A popular aproach when building themes is to make changes in an already existing theme, to get the prefered appearance and functionality. If the theme's licence aproves, we can do this by simply editing directly in the theme's files. Most published themes will sooner or later have updates available, which are simple to make via the admin dashboard. However, if changes were made directly in the theme files, these would become overwritten when performing the update, leaving us with the misery of undone work.

###Child theme
Wordpress has solved this by introducing *child themes*, which enables us to make all changes as a separate theme, without touching the main theme. Updates can be made on the main theme, without touching our child theme. While this aproach is preferable and more safe, a deep understanding of the main theme is needed to extend it effectively.
