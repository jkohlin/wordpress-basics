## Creating plugins

All we need to create a plugin is a PHP-file with a plugin header. This header describe the plugin and tell something about the author and licence. But the only required header information is the plugin's name.

    <?php
    /*
    Plugin Name: Reverse author plugin
    */

When placed in the plugin folder, a plugin called *"Reverse authro plugin"* will show up in admin dashboard where a user can turn it on and off.

Now, in same plugin file, we can use the filter hook we made earlier to reverse the author's name on the website.

	<?php
	/*
	Plugin Name: Reverse author plugin
	*/

	add_filter( 'author_name', 'change_site_main_link' );
    
    function reverse_author_name($author_name) {
      return strrev($author_name); //Return the filtered content
    }
    
And our plugin is created! We can do much more, and should probably wrap the code inside a class. But we don't have to.
