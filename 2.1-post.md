## The Wordpress post
When Wordpress was new and nothing but a blogging platform, a post in Wordpress was equal to a blog entry. Since then posts are used for almost anything, and can hold data far more complex than a blog entry.

To better understand what posts are, we will take a look on the database design. 

When installed, Wordpress creates a set of tables in the database. One of these tables is **wp_posts** where much of the website's content will be located.

The rows in the wp_posts table will hold all the website's content. Let's dissect the most important of the fields, and pretend we are looking at an article from a news site.

#### ID
The unique key to this article.

#### post_author
Who wrote this article? A reference ID to the responsible Wordpress user.

#### post_date
When was this article first published?

#### post_content

The article's primary content with text, html and embedded images.

#### post_title
What is the title of this article?

#### post_status
Is this article published? Or is it still pending, awating approval? This field can have the following values:

- publish (Live on the website.)
- future (Will be automatically published on a set date and time.)
- draft (Under development and visible only to the author.)
- pending (Awaiting a user with the capability to publish the article.)
- private (Viewable only to WordPress users at Administrator level.)
- trash (Deleted article)

#### post_type
As all content in Wordpress is a post and stored in this table, we need a way of knowing what kind of content each post holds. Each post type holds different properties and behavior, and a developer can define new custom post types. When installing Wordpress we get a bunch of preinstalled default types:

| name  |  used for |
|---|---|
| post  | non hierarchial content (blog entries, news, etc.) |
|  page | hierarchial content (web pages)  |
| attachment  |  files and media (information for a specific data file) |
| revision  | autosaved post versions |
| nav_menu_item  | custom menu items |
 
### Post Meta
Post meta is extended data fields for posts, that are stored in a separate database table. The rows in this table are key/value pairs with a reference to a specific post ID in **wp_posts** table. This enables us to extend the default content fields in admin dashboard, when writing content. In the admin dashboard, these key/value pairs are refered to as **custom fields**. 

### Post Format
When rendering content with a PHP-templates we sometimes need to adapt the layuot to fit the content. Post format is a value which set by the author when creating the content. There are a number of pre-set values available and we are limited to use one of the values to describe our content. The currently available values are:

- aside
- gallery
- link
- image
- quote
- status
- video
- audio
- chat

Remember that the post format value itself **does not** control any behavior or layout. It's all up to you as a theme developer what to do with the information.
