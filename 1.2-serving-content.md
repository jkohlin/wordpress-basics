## Serving content
A content manager is useless if we can't get the content out to our audience. 

With Wordpress we can serve our content in different ways, most common method involves serving HTML content. With this method, Wordpress takes clients' HTTP-requests and return the requested data in pre-rendered HTML-files. It's always recommended to cache common client requests, so that a HTML-copy is stored on the server, instead of generating the same HTML-content for each request beeing made.

### REST API
The theme doesn't necessary need to render any HTML at all. Serving the data can be made by using Wordpress REST API where the respone instead becomes pure JSON data. The theme will then have to set the rules of the API and expose the content to be served.
