## Serving content
Serving content is made with Wordpress Themes, a set of files which controls the visual output of content to the frontend website. Other than displaying data, the theme can extend Wordpress core functionality and customize the Wordpress Dashboard to fit the workflow and content.

The theme doesn't neccesary need to render any HTML at all. Serving the data can be made by using Wordpress REST API where the respone is pure JSON data. The theme will then have to set the rules of the API and expose the content to be served.
