## Widgets

Widgets are small content/functionality blocks that can be added and controlled from the admin dashboard. They are placed into **widget areas** by a drag-and-drop interface. A theme can have one or many widget areas, which have to be defined by the theme developer.

Wordpress comes with default widgets which can be extended with a plugin or definitions in the theme. 

The main reason to use widgets is to include general content not bound to a specific page or post. As all widget areas are defined in templates, all pages and posts on the website will show all widgets applied to that template/area.
