## Templates

Templates are used to render posts on the frontend. Technically they are regular PHP-files with Wordpress method calls mixed with HTML-markup.

When a post is requested from the frontend, Wordpress will select which template to use by using a set of rules. These rules  uses the template's filename, or if defined, a specific Template name. If no suiting template is found, Wordpress will fall back to using the file `index.php`, which is the only required template file for a theme to work.

Posts with hierarchial post types (ie. page) use the following flow of rules to find their template:

1. Template name – The page template manually assigned to the page.
2. page-{slug}.php – If the page slug is recent-news, WordPress will look to use page-recent-news.php.
3. page-{id}.php – If the page ID is 6, WordPress will look to use page-6.php.
4. page.php
5. singular.php
6. index.php

Posts with non-hierarchial post types (ie. post) use this flow of rules to find their template:

1. single-{post-type}-{slug}.php – (Since 4.4) First, WordPress looks for a template for the specific post. For example, if post type is product and the post slug is dmc-12, WordPress would look for single-product-dmc-12.php.
2. single-{post-type}.php – If the post type is product, WordPress would look for single-product.php.
3. single.php – WordPress then falls back to single.php.
4. singular.php – Then it falls back to singular.php.
5. index.php – Finally, as mentioned above, WordPress ultimately falls back to index.php.

> Creating more templates shall be done with great care and not just to make small variantions of a layout. One template can present content i various ways with the help of PHP logic.

Below is an example of a theme's default template `index.php`:

    <?php

    get_header(); ?>

    <div id="main-content" class="main-content">

        <div id="primary" class="content-area">
            <div id="content" class="site-content" role="main">

            <?php
                if ( have_posts() ) :
                    // Start the Loop.
                    while ( have_posts() ) : the_post();
                        get_template_part( 'content', get_post_format() );
                    endwhile;
                else :
                    // If no content, include the "No posts found" template.
                    get_template_part( 'content', 'none' );
                endif;
            ?>

            </div><!-- #content -->
        </div><!-- #primary -->
        <?php get_sidebar( 'content' ); ?>
    </div><!-- #main-content -->

    <?php
    get_sidebar();
    get_footer();
    
### Retrieve post data

Wordpress has built-in methods to output post data. Used inside The Loop, they work by either returning or echoing out the data value.

The most general method to get any post field is `get_post_field( $field, $post_id, $context )`. This method is not very common, as there are more simple helper mthods to retrieve specific content:

* **the_title()** Echoes out the current post's title field value with `<h1>` as default.
* **get_the_title()** Returns the current post's title field value.

* **the_content()** Echoes out the current post's content field value.
* **get_the_content()** Returns the current post's content field value.

* **the_permalink()** Echoes out the current post's public URL.
* **get_permalink()** Returns the current post's public URL. 

**have_posts()** is a boolean method which will return true as long as there are posts left in the array.

**the_post()** Gets the next post in the array, sets up the post and iterates the loop to next index. By "setting up the post" we can access the content of that post.
