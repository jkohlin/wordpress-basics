## Post types
Post types are variations of the content model, and control the posts' behavior and where in the admin dashboard they are managed. Two common and similar post types are *post* and *page*. They both are available by default and don't have to be registered by a developer. 

### Post
Not to be confused with the general **Wordpress Post**, the **post type** *post* is just one of many types. When running a blog or a website with any editorial content, each article, blog entry or similar would be written as a post. This post type is non-hierarchial meaning posts can't be ordered in a tree-like structure with parents and children. Instead all posts are at the same level. Posts within this post type are often ordered by their publish date.

### Page
The *page* **post type** is in contrast to *post* hierarchial and can thereby be ordered in a tree-like structure. This makes this post type perfect for building pages and sub-pages in a regular website. Pages are often ordered manually instead of their publish date.

### Default post types
| name | used for |
| post | non hierarchial content (blog entries, news, etc.) |
| page | hierarchial content (web pages) |
| attachment |  files and media (information for a specific data file) |
| revision | autosaved post versions |
| nav_menu_item | custom menu items |

### Custom post types
As developer we can add as any types we need, and tell Wordpress how to handle the posts with that post type. Post types and their rules are not stored in the database, but created at runtime. Post type definitions therefore need to be defined and described with PHP code, in a theme or plugin. 

> As theme developers we need to carefully plan the content of the websites and how it will be managed. Good practice is to keep the custom post types at a minimum. Content variations can be made within one same post type, so creating new post types really demands for separation of functionality and content.

**Post type options**
These are some of the many options we can use to describe a new custom post type:

* Label / Labels: What the post type is called in admin dashboard
* Show in menu: If the post type will have an own section in admin dashbaord.
* Menu icon: The icon to use in the tab for the section in admin dashboard.
* Hierarchical: If the type is hierarchical or non-hierarchical.
* Supports: Which default content fields to show in admin dashboard for posts with this type.
* Rewrite: Describing the url path to posts with this post type.

## Editor Workflow (creating posts)
1. In the dashboard's main menu, navigate to the section which holds the desired content.
2. Click the **Add Post** button (or corresponding button naming).
3. Fill in the content fields.
4. Publish the post to make it publicly visible.

## Developer workflow (creating a new custom post type)
1. In functions.php, create a new custom PHP function with a describing name.
2. Inside the function, call the Wordpress method `register_post_type()` with arguments for the new post type.
3. Add the new function to the **init hook**.

```
function my_custom_post_type() {
    $args = array(
      'public' => true,
      'label'  => 'Books'
    );
    register_post_type( 'book', $args );
}
add_action( 'init', 'my_custom_post_type' ); 
```
