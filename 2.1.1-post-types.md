## Post types
Post types are variations of the content model, and control the posts' behavior and where in the admin dashboard they are managed. Two common and similar post types are *post* and *page*. They both are available by default and don't have to be registered by a developer. 

### Post
Not to be confused with the general **Wordpress Post**, the **post type** *post* is just one of many types. When running a blog or a website with any editorial content, each article, blog entry or similar would be written as a post. This post type is non-hierarchial meaning posts can't be ordered in a tree-like structure with parents and children. Instead all posts are at the same level. Posts within this post type are often ordered by their publish date.

### Page
The *page* **post type** is in contrast to *post* hierarchial and can thereby be ordered in a tree-like structure. This makes this post type perfect for building pages and sub-pages in a regular website. Pages are often ordered manually instead of their publish date.

## Editor Workflow (creating posts)
1. In the dashboard's main menu, navigate to the section which holds the desired content.
2. Click the **Add Post** button (or corresponding button naming).
3. Fill in the content fields.
4. Publish the post to make it publicly visible.

## Developer workflow (creating a new custom post type)
1. In functions.php, create a new custom PHP function with a describing name.
2. Inside the function, call the Wordpress method `register_post_type()` with arguments for the new post type.
3. Add the new function to the **init hook**.

```
function my_custom_post_type() {
    $args = array(
      'public' => true,
      'label'  => 'Books'
    );
    register_post_type( 'book', $args );
}
add_action( 'init', 'my_custom_post_type' ); 
```
