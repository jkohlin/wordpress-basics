# Project - Personal portfolio theme
You are going to build a new Wordpress theme for a personal portfolio, to present some kind of creative work along with contact and bio. The theme will be built from scratch, and you will add only the absolute required components. The result will be a very lightweight and simple theme which you can use as it is, or extend into something more complex.

### The website plan
Take a look at the premade wireframes describing the website: [Wireframe sketches](documents/portfolio-theme-wireframes.pdf)

> Note: In the assignment only the theme folder must be version controlled with Git.

### Prerequisites
* A working local Wordpress installation
* Git installed locally
* A Github account

### Project plan
The project is divided into three assignments:

1. **Theme setup** - Creating the required files for theme activation.
2. **Content plan** - Preparing Wordpress backend and adding the content.
3. **Templates** - Presenting the content to the frontend.
