# Project - Personal portfolio theme
You are going to build a new Wordpress theme for a personal portfolio, to present some kind of creative work along with contact and bio. The theme will be built from scratch, and you will add only the absolute required components. The result will be a very lightweight and simple theme which you can use as it is, or extend into something more complex.

In the assignment only the theme folder will be version controlled with Git.

### Prerequisites
* A working local Wordpress installation
* Git installed locally
* A Github account
* Personal repository via Github Classroom

### Github Classroom
Github Classroom will be used as your remote Git repository, where your teacher can follow and comment on your work. You will work in your local environment and push to the remote repository after each assignment.

1. Generate your personal theme repository:

2. Clone the Github repository into your local themes folder (make sure you pick the SSH clone URL).

### Project plan
The project is divided into three parts:

1. **Theme setup** - Creating the required files for theme activation.
2. **Structure & content** - Preparing Wordpress backend for our content.
3. **Templates** - Presenting our content to the frontend.
4. **Style and scripts** - Giving life and color to the frontend website.
