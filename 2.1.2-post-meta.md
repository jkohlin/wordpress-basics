## Post Meta

Post meta is extended data fields for posts, that are stored in a separate database table. The rows in this table are key/value pairs with a reference to a specific post ID in wp_posts table. This enables us to extend the default content fields in admin dashboard, when writing content. In the admin dashboard, these key/value pairs are refered to as custom fields.
